# BitCraftPublic

This repository contains the **server-side code** for **BitCraft**, a community sandbox MMORPG developed by Clockwork Labs.

BitCraft blends cooperative gameplay, city-building, crafting, exploration, and survival — all in a single seamless world shared by players around the globe.
This repository represents the first phase of our open source initiative. It is being made available for public inspection, experimentation, and contribution.

In this first phase we are only open sourcing the server side code.

## About BitCraft

BitCraft is a community-driven MMORPG where players collaborate to shape a procedurally generated world. There are no fixed classes or roles — instead, players build, craft, explore, trade,
and govern together to shape their civilizations.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the code for running a BitCraft server. It includes game logic, state management, and server-side systems, but does not include the client or tools required to connect to the official game.

The server is built using [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com), a real-time, reactive database designed for multiplayer game development.
The BitCraft server is structured as a SpacetimeDB module, all the data is stored in spacetimeDB `tables` and all the logic runs inside `reducers`.
If you're interested in exploring the server or trying to run a minimal version locally, start with the spacetimeDB documentation:
