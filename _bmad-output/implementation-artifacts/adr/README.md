# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Sigil SDK project. ADRs document significant architectural and design decisions, capturing the context, alternatives considered, and rationale for each decision.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title:** ADR-NNN: [Short descriptive title]
- **Status:** Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Deciders:** List of people involved in the decision
- **Context:** What problem were we solving?
- **Options Considered:** What alternatives did we evaluate?
- **Decision:** What did we choose?
