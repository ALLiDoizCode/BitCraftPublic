# 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the architecture for an **AI Agent SDK** that enables LLM-powered agents to play BitCraft — a SpacetimeDB-based MMORPG — as first-class participants. The SDK provides a pluggable five-layer cognition framework, an experiment harness for AI researchers, and integrates with the existing Crosstown payment infrastructure for ILP-gated actions.

**Target User:** AI researchers studying multi-agent behavior in constrained environments.

**Success Metric:** A researcher deploys two agents with different LLM backends against the same BitCraft world, observes both making independent economic decisions for 1 hour, and exports a comparative decision log.
