# 14. Licensing & Legal

**BitCraft Server (Apache 2.0)**
- Commercial use, modification, and distribution: **Permitted**
- Derivative works with different license terms: **Permitted** (Section 4)
- Explicit README allowance: *"Make a game similar to BitCraft with your own IP using our code as a basis"*
- Explicit README allowance: *"Use it as a reference for building your own projects"*

**Requirements:**
- Retain Apache 2.0 license and copyright notices in the BitCraft Server code
- Mark modified files with prominent change notices (if we modify — we don't plan to)
- Do NOT use BitCraft trademarks, IP, art, or branding
- Do NOT present the project as official BitCraft

**Our Agent SDK:** Licensed separately (recommend MIT or Apache 2.0 for maximum researcher adoption).

**Risk Assessment:** Low. We run unmodified BitCraft in Docker as a game environment. Our product is the Agent SDK — a separate, original work. We don't compete with BitCraft (AI research platform vs human MMORPG), don't use their IP, and don't operate public-facing servers.
